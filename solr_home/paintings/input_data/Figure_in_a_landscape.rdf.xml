Based on a photograph of Eric Hall dozing on a seat in Hyde Park, also the basis of another painting held in the Lefevre Figure in a landscape (1945) which was bought by Diana Watson and later in 1950 by the Tate gallery (with the support of Graham Sutherland, then a trustee . Figure Study was destroyed; "Figure Study I2 and "Figure Study II" are from 1945 or 1946. Study for Man with Microphones was shown at the Lefevre gallery,, and at the Anglo-French Art Centre, . Bacon was clearly unhappy with this picture: it was listed as an abandoned work in the 1964 catalogue raisonné, and was passed on to the Estate in 1992 as a slashed canvas. At some point in 1947–1948, Bacon returned to make a second version, Study for Man with Microphones . Crucifixion was shown at the Summer Exhibition at the Redfern Gallery, 19/20 Cork Street, London, and bought by Sir Colin Anderson.</field>
