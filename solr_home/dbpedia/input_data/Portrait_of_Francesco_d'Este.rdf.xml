<field name="abstract">Portrait of Francesco d'Este is a small oil on wood panel painting by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden dating to around 1460. The work is in good condition and has been in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York since 1931. When it was identified as a van der Weyden in the early 20th century, there was much speculation amongst art historians as to the sitter's identity. He was identified as a member of the d'Este family from the crest on the reverse, but thought by many commentators to be Francesco's father Lionello, an Italian but highly placed Burgundian prince and patron of Rogier. In 1939 Ernst Kantorowicz identified the man as Lionello's illegitimate son Francesco (c. 1430 – after 1475), which is now generally accepted. The panel was painted when the sitter was about 30 years old and is considered one of van der Weyden's finest portraits, in many ways a culmination of his later, more austere work. Van der Weyden seeks to flatter d'Este; although he is not handsome, he is shown as broad chested, with a sensitive and cultured face, keen expression, long neck and aquiline nose. The hammer and ring (the latter only revealed after a 1934 cleaning) clutched in his hand are likely intended as status symbols although their exact significance has not been positively identified. Typically of van der Weyden, the sitter's fingers are highly detailed and prominent, shown as almost resting on the lower left of the panel frame, and are long, bony and highly detailed. The painting is unusually secular for the time, seeking to flatter d'Este's worldly position, rather than highlight his devotional worth or personal humility. The portrait follows the structural conventions of van der Weyden's later career male portraits; a half length, three quarters view of the sitter against a plain and shallow background. The background is one of the work's most striking features, its shallowness is at odds with the deep, shadowed and atmospheric kind popular in Northern art since the innovations of van Eyck. In addition, that the background is layered with white—rather the more typical dark grey and black- tones and shades has been remarked on by many art historians.</field>
